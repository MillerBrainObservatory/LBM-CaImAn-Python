    "> Spatial footprint consistency (rval): The spatial footprint of the component is compared with the frames where this component is active. Other componentâ€™s signals are subtracted from these frames, and the resulting raw data is correlated against the spatial component. This ensures that the raw data at the spatial footprint aligns with the extracted trace.\n",
